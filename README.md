Research Goal:

To determine the appropriate level for rent a real estate company should be listing their properties, and which properties are most likely to increase in the next five years. Questions to answer:

    - What are the most important internal and external features in predicting rental prices?

    - What are the top 10 suburbs with the highest predicted growth rate?

    - What are the most livable and affordable suburbs according to you chosen metrics?


## Instructions:

1. check you have relevent modules with `requirements.txt`
2. to download and preprocess data, navigate working directory to the scripts folder in terminal and run `run_scripts.py` which runs all scripts (excluding those requiring webscraping or api keys)
3. for feature analysis, run `analysis_properties.ipynb` (Question 1)
4. to get a forecast of prices, run `forecasting.ipynb` (Question 2)
5. for the most liveable and affordable suburbs, run `affordability.ipynb` and `liveability.ipynb` (Question 3)
6. for visualisation, run `geopandas_visualsations.ipynb` and `visualise_ors.ipynb` (note `visualise_ors.ipynb` requires an api key for certain blocks of code and is optional to run)
7. to get the tool dataset, run `toolsetup.py` (note this first requires running of steps 4 and 5 for the necessary datasets)
8. to use the tool, run `tooluse.py`
9. Run `summary.ipynb` for the summary (note this first requires running of steps 1 to 5)
